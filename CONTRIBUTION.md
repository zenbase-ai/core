# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Any and all contributions are welcome. This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing.

## Bug Reports

If you find a bug in the code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Feature Requests

If you'd like to make a feature request, you can do so by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. You can also submit a Pull Request to help implement that feature.

## Pull Requests

Here are some guidelines for submitting a pull request:

- Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local repository to the original `upstream` repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from `upstream` often so that you stay up to date with the latest code.
- Create a branch for your edits.
- Be clear about what problem is occurring and how someone can reproduce that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
- It's always best to consult the existing issues before creating a new one.
