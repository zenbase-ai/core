# Zenbase AI SDK —  Prompt engineering, automated.

The Zenbase AI SDK is the library for programming — not prompting — AI in production. It is a spin-out of [Stanford NLP's DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) project started by key contributors. DSPy is an excellent framework for R&D. Zenbase strives to be its brother for software engineering.

## Key Points

- **DSPy** is optimized for research and development, providing tools specifically designed for deep exploration and optimization of AI systems. You run experiments with AI systems and report the results.
- **Zenbase** focuses on adapting these research advancements to practical software engineering needs. Optimizers can be integrated into existing systems. We're focused on helping you deploy automatic prompt optimization in production.

## Quick Start with Python

```bash
pip install zenbase
```

For more information take a look at the [Zenbase Python SDK](./py/README.md).
